# Project Brief: egraph-rs

## Project Overview

egraph-rs is a Rust library providing graph data structures, algorithms, quality metrics, and drawing functionality. It offers a comprehensive toolkit for graph manipulation and visualization through multiple interfaces.

## Core Requirements

- Provide robust graph data structures in Rust
- Implement various graph algorithms and layout techniques
- Support drawing capabilities in multiple geometric spaces (Euclidean, Spherical, Hyperbolic, Torus)
- Enable access from different environments (Rust, Python, WebAssembly/JavaScript)
- Maintain high-quality metrics for evaluating graph layouts

## Goals

- Create a unified API across multiple platforms
- Provide efficient implementations of graph algorithms
- Support various graph visualization techniques
- Ensure comprehensive documentation and examples
- Maintain a modular architecture for extensibility

## Scope

The project is organized as a Rust workspace comprising multiple crates, each focused on specific functionality:

- Algorithm crates for graph algorithms
- Layout crates for positioning nodes
- Drawing capabilities for visualization
- Quality metrics for evaluating layouts
- Language bindings (Python, WebAssembly)
