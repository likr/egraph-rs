# Product Context: egraph-rs

## Why This Project Exists

egraph-rs exists to provide a comprehensive, high-performance graph manipulation and visualization library in Rust. It fills the need for a native Rust implementation with cross-language bindings, enabling graph algorithms and visualizations across various platforms and use cases.

## Problems It Solves

- **Performance Gap**: Provides efficient Rust implementations of graph algorithms that outperform many existing libraries
- **Language Barrier**: Bridges multiple programming environments (Rust, Python, JavaScript) with consistent APIs
- **Visualization Variety**: Offers multiple geometric spaces for graph visualization (Euclidean, Spherical, Hyperbolic, Torus)
- **Quality Assessment**: Provides metrics to quantitatively evaluate the quality of graph layouts

## How It Should Work

The library should provide:

- Intuitive APIs for creating and manipulating graphs
- Efficient implementations of common graph algorithms
- Various layout algorithms to position graph nodes effectively
- Quality metrics to evaluate visualization effectiveness
- Seamless integration with other languages and environments

## User Experience Goals

- **Consistent API**: Maintain similar interfaces across all platforms
- **Performance**: Prioritize speed and memory efficiency
- **Flexibility**: Support various graph types and visualization techniques
- **Extensibility**: Allow users to extend the system with custom algorithms
- **Documentation**: Provide clear examples and documentation across all parts of the library
