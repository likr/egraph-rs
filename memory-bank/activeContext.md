## Recent Changes

- **Omega Algorithm Complete Refactoring and Enhancement (2025-01-06)**

  - **Comprehensive Implementation Overhaul**: Completely redesigned the Omega algorithm implementation to address all identified issues

  - **Edge Length Integration**:

    - **Issue Fixed**: Edge lengths were previously ignored (`_length` parameter unused)
    - **Solution**: Implemented weighted Laplacian using `LaplacianStructure::new(graph, length)`
    - **Impact**: Proper edge weight support enables more accurate graph representation

  - **Efficient Laplacian Operations**:

    - **Issue Fixed**: Graph Laplacian rebuilt from scratch every time, causing redundant computations
    - **Solution**: Created `LaplacianStructure<S>` that pre-computes and caches:
      - Edge list with weights: `Vec<(usize, usize, S)>`
      - Node degrees: `Vec<S>`
      - Node count: `usize`
    - **Impact**: Eliminates repeated computations during eigenvalue iteration

  - **Optimized Quadratic Form Computation**:

    - **Issue Fixed**: Used inefficient full matrix-vector multiplication for Rayleigh quotient
    - **Solution**: Implemented `LaplacianStructure::quadratic_form()` with O(|E|) complexity
    - **Formula**: `x^T L x = Σ_{(i,j) ∈ E} weight[i,j] * (x[i] - x[j])^2`
    - **Impact**: Significant performance improvement from O(|V|²) to O(|E|)

  - **Configurable EigenSolver Parameters**:

    - **Issue Fixed**: EigenSolver parameters were hardcoded and not customizable
    - **Solution**: Implemented `OmegaOption<S>` with Builder pattern supporting:
      - `d`: Number of spectral dimensions
      - `k`: Number of random pairs per node
      - `min_dist`: Minimum distance between node pairs
      - `max_iterations`: Maximum iterations for inverse power method
      - `cg_max_iterations`: Maximum iterations for CG method
      - `tolerance`: Convergence tolerance for eigenvalues
      - `cg_tolerance`: Convergence tolerance for CG method
      - `vector_tolerance`: Convergence tolerance for eigenvectors
    - **Impact**: Full control over algorithm parameters and performance trade-offs

  - **Proper Random Vector Generation**:

    - **Issue Fixed**: Used deterministic sine function instead of actual randomness
    - **Solution**: Uses actual RNG: `rng.gen_range(-1.0..1.0)` while maintaining reproducibility
    - **Impact**: True randomness improves algorithm quality while preserving deterministic results with seeded RNG

  - **Static Function Refactoring**:

    - **Issue Fixed**: Utility functions unnecessarily implemented as instance methods
    - **Solution**: Converted to static associated functions:
      - `euclidean_distance()`, `generate_random_vector()`, `gram_schmidt_orthogonalize()`
      - `dot_product()`, `normalize()`
    - **Impact**: Better code organization and clearer intent

  - **New Builder Pattern API**:

    ```rust
    // Before: 6 individual parameters
    Omega::new(graph, length, d, k, min_dist, rng)

    // After: Clean options-based API
    let options = OmegaOption::new()
        .d(3).k(50).min_dist(1e-2)
        .max_iterations(2000).tolerance(1e-5);
    Omega::new(graph, length, options, rng)
    ```

  - **Enhanced Eigenvalue Implementation**:

    - **LaplacianStructure Integration**: Eigenvalue solver now uses precomputed Laplacian structure
    - **Optimized Methods**: `compute_smallest_eigenvalues_with_laplacian()` for direct structure usage
    - **Performance**: Maintains O(d(|V| + |E|) + k|V|) computational complexity with significant constant factor improvements

  - **Updated CLI and Testing**:

    - **CLI Binary**: Updated `crates/cli/src/bin/omega.rs` to use new OmegaOption API
    - **Comprehensive Testing**: All tests updated and passing with new API

## Workflow Corrections and Guidelines

### Corrected Commit Message Rules (Updated 2025-01-06)

**CRITICAL**: The following workflow must be followed for ALL tasks without exception:

#### Conventional Commits Format

All commit messages must follow this exact format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore

**Scoping Rules**:

- **Crate-specific changes**: Use crate name as scope (e.g., `petgraph-layout-omega`, `egraph-wasm`, `petgraph-layout-mds`)
- **Project-wide changes**: Omit scope entirely (e.g., root configuration files, memory-bank updates, workspace-level changes)

**Examples**:

- `feat(petgraph-layout-omega): add min_dist parameter for numerical stability`
- `fix(egraph-wasm): resolve NaN values in ClassicalMds implementation`
- `test(petgraph-layout-sgd): add comprehensive tests for schedulers`
- `docs(petgraph-drawing): improve API documentation`
- `refactor(petgraph-algorithm-shortest-path): optimize distance calculation`
- `docs: update project workflow guidelines` (no scope for project-wide)
- `chore: update workspace dependencies` (no scope for workspace-level)

#### Mandatory Final Confirmation Process

**This step must NEVER be skipped under any circumstances:**

1. **Run all required checks**:

   - `cargo fmt --all`
   - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
   - `cargo test --workspace` (or appropriate tests for the changes)

2. **Prepare comprehensive summary**:

   - List all files modified
   - Describe all changes made
   - Explain the impact and benefits

3. **Create proper commit message**:

   - Follow Conventional Commits format exactly
   - Use correct scope based on crates affected
   - Provide clear, concise description

4. **Present to user for approval**:

   - Show complete summary of changes
   - Present the proposed commit message
   - Wait for explicit user approval
   - Do not proceed without confirmation

5. **Only after user approval**: Mark task as complete

#### Scope Determination Guide

- **Single crate affected**: Use that crate's name as scope
- **Multiple crates in same domain**: Use the primary crate name or most relevant scope
- **Cross-cutting changes**: Choose the most impacted crate or omit scope if truly project-wide
- **Documentation/configuration**: Use specific crate if crate-specific, omit scope if project-wide
- **Memory bank updates**: No scope (project-wide documentation)
- **Root-level files**: No scope (project-wide)

### Workflow Enforcement

This corrected workflow addresses previous issues where:

- Commit messages didn't consistently follow Conventional Commits format
- Scoping rules weren't properly applied
- Final confirmation step was sometimes skipped
- Commit message proposals weren't always provided

**All future tasks must follow this corrected workflow without exception.**
