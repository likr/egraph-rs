## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the clustering capabilities through community detection algorithms, while continuing to improve the WebAssembly bindings and layout algorithms in the graph visualization system:

1. **Community Detection Algorithms** for identifying clusters/communities in graphs:

   - Implemented a common `CommunityDetection` trait that all algorithms implement
   - Each algorithm returns `HashMap<G::NodeId, usize>` mapping nodes to community IDs
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
   - Implemented four key algorithms:
     - **Louvain Method**: Modularity optimization approach that iteratively moves nodes between communities to maximize modularity
     - **Label Propagation**: Fast and simple algorithm that works by propagating labels through the network
     - **Spectral Clustering**: Uses eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix to identify communities
     - **InfoMap**: Information-theoretic approach that minimizes description length

2. **WebAssembly Binding Tests**

   - Creating dedicated test files for each class and function
   - Implementing tests that can be run individually with `wasm-pack test --node --test <filename>`
   - Testing both basic functionality and integration with other components
   - Following the pattern: `tests/<component>.rs` and `tests/<component>.js`
   - Initial implementation for the `Rng` class (random number generation)

3. **Layout Algorithms** in the graph visualization system, particularly:

4. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** implementations

   - Full SGD (all-pairs shortest path distances)
   - Sparse SGD (pivot-based sparse approximation)
   - Distance-adjusted SGD (dynamic distance adjustment)
   - Various learning rate schedulers:
     - Constant: Maintains a fixed learning rate
     - Linear: Linear decay of learning rate
     - Exponential: Exponential decay of learning rate
     - Quadratic: Quadratic decay of learning rate
     - Reciprocal: Reciprocal decay of learning rate
   - Based on research: Zheng, J. X., Pawar, S., & Goodman, D. F. (2018). "Graph drawing by stochastic gradient descent"

5. **Stress Majorization** algorithm

   - Iterative stress minimization
   - Conjugate gradient solver
   - Based on research: Gansner et al. (2004) "Graph drawing by stress majorization"

6. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** implementations

   - Classical MDS: Standard implementation that computes a full distance matrix
   - Pivot MDS: Efficient implementation that uses a subset of nodes as pivots
   - Uses eigendecomposition and double centering to transform distance matrices
   - Based on research: Cox, T. F., & Cox, M. A. (2000). Multidimensional scaling. Chapman & Hall/CRC.

7. **Overlap Removal** techniques for improving readability

8. **Quality Metrics** for evaluating layout effectiveness
   - Stress: How well layout preserves graph-theoretical distances
   - Ideal Edge Lengths: How well edge lengths match their ideal lengths
   - Neighborhood Preservation: How well the layout preserves local neighborhoods
   - Crossing Number: Count of edge crossings in the layout
   - Edge Angle: Angles at which edges cross
   - Aspect Ratio: Balance between width and height of the drawing
   - Angular Resolution: Angles between edges connected to the same node
   - Node Resolution: How well nodes are distributed in the drawing space
   - Gabriel Graph Property: Adherence to the Gabriel graph condition

  - Made the triangulation function generic over scalar types with appropriate trait bounds
  - Updated documentation to reflect the new function signature and usage
  - Implemented a new function `generate_rectangle_no_overlap_constraints_triangulated` in the separation-constraints crate that:
    - Takes a DrawingEuclidean2d as input

    - Collinear points (3 nodes in a line)
    - Constant node sizes
  - Verified that all tests pass, including doc-tests
  - The implementation is more efficient than the original function for large graphs because it only checks node pairs that are adjacent in the triangulated graph, rather than checking all possible pairs (which would be O(nÂ²))
  - The function is already being used in the example application (qh882_separation_constraints.rs)

- Implemented Delaunay triangulation algorithm:

  - Created a new crate `petgraph-algorithm-triangulation` in `crates/algorithm/triangulation`
