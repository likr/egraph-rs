# Active Context: egraph-rs

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the WebAssembly bindings with comprehensive tests, while continuing work on the layout algorithms in the graph visualization system:

1. **WebAssembly Binding Tests**

   - Creating dedicated test files for each class and function
   - Implementing tests that can be run individually with `wasm-pack test --node --test <filename>`
   - Testing both basic functionality and integration with other components
   - Following the pattern: `tests/<component>.rs` and `tests/<component>.js`
   - Initial implementation for the `Rng` class (random number generation)

2. **Layout Algorithms** in the graph visualization system, particularly:

3. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** implementations

   - Full SGD (all-pairs shortest path distances)
   - Sparse SGD (pivot-based sparse approximation)
   - Distance-adjusted SGD (dynamic distance adjustment)
   - Various learning rate schedulers:
     - Constant: Maintains a fixed learning rate
     - Linear: Linear decay of learning rate
     - Exponential: Exponential decay of learning rate
     - Quadratic: Quadratic decay of learning rate
     - Reciprocal: Reciprocal decay of learning rate
   - Based on research: Zheng, J. X., Pawar, S., & Goodman, D. F. (2018). "Graph drawing by stochastic gradient descent"

4. **Stress Majorization** algorithm

   - Iterative stress minimization
   - Conjugate gradient solver
   - Based on research: Gansner et al. (2004) "Graph drawing by stress majorization"

5. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** implementations

   - Classical MDS: Standard implementation that computes a full distance matrix
   - Pivot MDS: Efficient implementation that uses a subset of nodes as pivots
   - Uses eigendecomposition and double centering to transform distance matrices
   - Based on research: Cox, T. F., & Cox, M. A. (2000). Multidimensional scaling. Chapman & Hall/CRC.

6. **Overlap Removal** techniques for improving readability

7. **Quality Metrics** for evaluating layout effectiveness
   - Stress: How well layout preserves graph-theoretical distances
   - Ideal Edge Lengths: How well edge lengths match their ideal lengths
   - Neighborhood Preservation: How well the layout preserves local neighborhoods
   - Crossing Number: Count of edge crossings in the layout
   - Edge Angle: Angles at which edges cross
   - Aspect Ratio: Balance between width and height of the drawing
   - Angular Resolution: Angles between edges connected to the same node
   - Node Resolution: How well nodes are distributed in the drawing space
   - Gabriel Graph Property: Adherence to the Gabriel graph condition

## Recent Changes

## Project Workflow Guidelines

The following guidelines have been established for the project workflow:

1. **Test Execution from Project Root**:

   - All tests should be run from the project root directory using Cargo's workspace options
   - Use `cargo test --workspace` to run all tests
   - Use `cargo test -p <crate-name>` to run tests for a specific crate (e.g., `cargo test -p petgraph-layout-mds`)
   - Use `cargo test -p <crate-name> <test-name>` to run a specific test (e.g., `cargo test -p egraph-wasm sgd_full`)
   - For WebAssembly binding tests:
     - Run all WebAssembly tests: `wasm-pack test --node crates/wasm`
     - Run specific test files: `wasm-pack test --node crates/wasm --test <test-name>` (e.g., `wasm-pack test --node crates/wasm --test sgd_full`)
   - This approach ensures consistent test environment and better dependency resolution

2. **Commit Message Format**:

   - Follow the format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   - For scope:
     - Use workspace crate names for changes specific to a crate
     - Omit scope for project-wide changes
   - Examples:
     - `feat(petgraph-layout-mds): add support for high-dimensional embeddings`
     - `fix(egraph-wasm): resolve NaN values in ClassicalMds implementation`
     - `test(petgraph-layout-sgd): add comprehensive tests for schedulers`
     - `docs: update project workflow guidelines` (project-wide change, no scope)

3. **Task Completion Process**:
   - When completing tasks, suggest appropriate commit messages following the format above
   - Ensure all tests are run from the project root before committing changes
   - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**: Always ask for final confirmation from the user before completing a task
     - Present a summary of all changes made
     - Include the proposed commit message
     - Wait for explicit approval before marking the task as complete
     - This confirmation step must never be skipped under any circumstances

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Performance Trade-offs**:

   - Balance between layout quality and computation speed
   - Memory usage optimization for large graphs
   - Addressing high memory consumption for dense graphs in WebAssembly context

2. **API Design**:

   - Ensure consistent interfaces across layout implementations
   - Consider future extensibility for new layout algorithms
   - Maintain API stability while allowing for improvements

3. **Cross-platform Consistency**:

   - Validate behavior consistency across Rust, WebAssembly, and Python
   - Ensure uniform error handling across language boundaries
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions appropriate to each language

4. **Known Issues to Address**:
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: PivotMds implementation was producing NaN values when trying to embed a graph in a space with dimensions higher than what's needed for the graph, similar to the fixed issue in ClassicalMds
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: MetricSpherical2d implementation had a bug that output NaN values, causing the SparseSgd spherical drawing test to fail. Fixed by adding safeguards against division by zero, handling edge cases for identical or very close points, and ensuring proper clamping of values for trigonometric functions.
   - üîÑ Needs improvement: StressMajorization run method can enter an infinite loop and needs to be improved with a proper convergence criterion or iteration limit

## Git Command Usage

When executing git commands that might trigger a pager view (such as `git diff`, `git log`, or `git show`), always use the `--no-pager` option to prevent interactive pager (less) from requiring manual input:

```bash
git --no-pager diff
git --no-pager log
git --no-pager show
```

This approach ensures that git commands can be executed without requiring interactive user operations to navigate through the output.
