# Active Context: egraph-rs

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the WebAssembly bindings with comprehensive tests, while continuing work on the layout algorithms in the graph visualization system:

1. **WebAssembly Binding Tests**

   - Creating dedicated test files for each class and function
   - Implementing tests that can be run individually with `wasm-pack test --node --test <filename>`
   - Testing both basic functionality and integration with other components
   - Following the pattern: `tests/<component>.rs` and `tests/<component>.js`
   - Initial implementation for the `Rng` class (random number generation)

2. **Layout Algorithms** in the graph visualization system, particularly:

3. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** implementations

   - Full SGD (all-pairs shortest path distances)
   - Sparse SGD (pivot-based sparse approximation)
   - Distance-adjusted SGD (dynamic distance adjustment)
   - Various learning rate schedulers:
     - Constant: Maintains a fixed learning rate
     - Linear: Linear decay of learning rate
     - Exponential: Exponential decay of learning rate
     - Quadratic: Quadratic decay of learning rate
     - Reciprocal: Reciprocal decay of learning rate
   - Based on research: Zheng, J. X., Pawar, S., & Goodman, D. F. (2018). "Graph drawing by stochastic gradient descent"

4. **Stress Majorization** algorithm

   - Iterative stress minimization
   - Conjugate gradient solver
   - Based on research: Gansner et al. (2004) "Graph drawing by stress majorization"

5. **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** implementations

   - Classical MDS: Standard implementation that computes a full distance matrix
   - Pivot MDS: Efficient implementation that uses a subset of nodes as pivots
   - Uses eigendecomposition and double centering to transform distance matrices
   - Based on research: Cox, T. F., & Cox, M. A. (2000). Multidimensional scaling. Chapman & Hall/CRC.

6. **Overlap Removal** techniques for improving readability

7. **Quality Metrics** for evaluating layout effectiveness
   - Stress: How well layout preserves graph-theoretical distances
   - Ideal Edge Lengths: How well edge lengths match their ideal lengths
   - Neighborhood Preservation: How well the layout preserves local neighborhoods
   - Crossing Number: Count of edge crossings in the layout
   - Edge Angle: Angles at which edges cross
   - Aspect Ratio: Balance between width and height of the drawing
   - Angular Resolution: Angles between edges connected to the same node
   - Node Resolution: How well nodes are distributed in the drawing space
   - Gabriel Graph Property: Adherence to the Gabriel graph condition

## Recent Changes

- Implemented cluster overlap removal in the separation-constraints module:

  - Created a new file `cluster_overlap.rs` in the `petgraph-layout-separation-constraints` module
  - Implemented the `project_clustered_rectangle_no_overlap_constraints` function that:
    - Takes a graph, a drawing, a dimension, a cluster ID function, and a node size function
    - Uses `coarsen` from petgraph-clustering to create a cluster graph
    - Calculates the bounding box for each cluster based on contained nodes

    - Collinear points (3 nodes in a line)
    - Constant node sizes
  - Verified that all tests pass, including doc-tests
  - The implementation is more efficient than the original function for large graphs because it only checks node pairs that are adjacent in the triangulated graph, rather than checking all possible pairs (which would be O(nÂ²))

  - Implemented tests for StressMajorization instantiation, applying a single iteration, and integration with other components
  - Identified an issue with the StressMajorization run method that can cause infinite loops, and implemented a workaround using multiple apply calls
  - Established a pattern for class/function-specific tests that can be run individually
  - Verified test execution with `wasm-pack test --node --test <filename>`

- Refined various layout algorithm implementations
- Improved documentations of drawing implementations for different geometric spaces:
  - Euclidean 2D: 2D Cartesian coordinate drawings
  - Spherical 2D: Drawings on a spherical surface
  - Hyperbolic 2D: Drawings in hyperbolic space
  - Torus 2D: Drawings on a torus surface
  - N-dimensional Euclidean: Drawings in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces
- Enhanced WebAssembly bindings with improved JavaScript API features:
  - Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for JavaScript)
  - JSDoc-style comments for better developer experience
  - Transparent data handling between Rust and JavaScript
