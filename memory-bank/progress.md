# Progress: egraph-rs

## What Works

### Graph Data Structures

- Base graph implementations (undirected and directed graphs)
- Node and edge management
- Generic data storage
- Common type definitions (`Node`, `Edge`, `IndexType`)

### Layout Algorithms

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Full implementation (all-pairs shortest path distances)
  - Sparse implementation (pivot-based sparse approximation)
  - Distance-adjusted implementation (dynamic distance adjustment)
  - Multiple scheduler strategies:
    - Constant, Linear, Exponential, Quadratic, Reciprocal
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
  - Classical MDS (full distance matrix)
  - Pivot MDS (subset of nodes as pivots)
- Stress Majorization
  - Iterative stress minimization
  - Conjugate gradient solver
- Kamada-Kawai (spring model based layout)
- Overlap Removal (resolving node overlaps)
- Separation Constraints (layout constraint implementation)

### Drawing Implementations

- Euclidean 2D drawing (2D Cartesian coordinate drawings)
- Spherical 2D drawing (drawings on a spherical surface)
- Hyperbolic 2D drawing (drawings in hyperbolic space)
- Torus 2D drawing (drawings on a torus surface)
- N-dimensional Euclidean drawing (higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces)

### Quality Metrics

- Stress metric (how well layout preserves graph-theoretical distances)
- Ideal edge length metric (how well edge lengths match their ideal lengths)
- Neighborhood preservation (how well the layout preserves local neighborhoods)
- Crossing number (count of edge crossings in the layout)
- Edge angle metric (angles at which edges cross)
- Aspect ratio (balance between width and height of the drawing)
- Angular resolution (angles between edges connected to the same node)
- Node resolution (how well nodes are distributed in the drawing space)
- Gabriel graph property (adherence to the Gabriel graph condition)

### Additional Features

- Edge bundling (force-directed edge bundling for reducing visual clutter)
- Clustering (graph clustering and coarsening for simplifying complex graphs)
- Random number generation (with seed control for reproducible layouts)

### Language Bindings

- Python bindings (via PyO3)
  - Consistent Python-style API (following PEP 8)
  - Type hints in documentation
- WebAssembly bindings (via wasm-bindgen)
  - JavaScript-friendly interfaces (camelCase naming)
  - JSDoc-style comments
  - Transparent data handling
  - Memory safety
  - Method chaining
  - Error handling
  - Callback support

## What's Left to Build

### Layout Algorithms

- Further optimization of layout algorithms for large graphs (>10,000 nodes)
- Performance improvements for dense graphs in WebAssembly context
- Additional layout algorithms (e.g., additional force-directed variants)
- Fine-tuning of SGD schedulers for better convergence
- Optimization of stress majorization for large graphs
- Performance improvements for overlap removal

### Documentation

- Tutorials for common use cases
- Best practices for selecting appropriate layout algorithms
- Usage examples for different geometric spaces

### Testing

- More comprehensive test suite with increased coverage
- Performance benchmarks for algorithm comparison
- Cross-platform consistency validation

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**:

   - Some layout algorithms may not scale well to very large graphs (>10,000 nodes)
   - SGD performance degrades with graph size, especially for full implementation
   - Stress majorization can be slow for large graphs

2. **Memory Usage**:

   - High memory consumption for dense graphs in WebAssembly context
   - Full distance matrices can exhaust memory for large graphs

3. **API Consistency**:

   - Some inconsistencies between language bindings (Rust, Python, JavaScript)
   - Naming conventions differ between platforms
   - Error handling approaches vary

4. **Documentation**:

   - Need more comprehensive examples and tutorials
   - Lack of detailed guidance on algorithm selection
   - Insufficient documentation on parameter tuning

5. **Cross-platform Issues**:
   - Some behaviors may differ slightly between Rust, Python, and JavaScript implementations
   - Performance characteristics vary across platforms
