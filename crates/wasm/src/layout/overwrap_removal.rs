//! Node overlap removal for WebAssembly.
//!
//! This module provides a WebAssembly binding for the overlap removal algorithm,
//! which adjusts node positions to resolve overlaps between nodes that are
//! represented as circles with defined radii. This is useful for improving the
//! readability of graph visualizations by ensuring nodes don't overlap.
