//! 2D hyperbolic drawing functionality for WebAssembly.
//!
//! This module provides a WebAssembly binding for representing graph drawings
//! in 2D hyperbolic space, which can be useful for visualizing large graphs
//! with hierarchical structure due to the exponential growth of area with distance.
